# STG_850_Arduino_CAN
CAN Example for BARTH STG-850 for Arduino IDE

This has been tested on a BATRTH STG-850 (https://barth-elektronik.com/en/lococube-mini-PLCs/lococube-mini-PLC-STG-850.html)

Since the STG-850 does not have internal termination resistors, external termination is needed.

Special thanks to nopnop2002 for his code as an example (https://github.com/nopnop2002/Arduino-STM32-CAN)
